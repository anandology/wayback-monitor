# Wayback Monitor

Wayback Monitor is a simple tool to monitor if the [Internet Archive][ia]'s [Wayback Machine][wb] is accessible or blocked by various ISPs across the world.

It tries to load the images from wayback machine and reports success or error to the server, allowing it to record the status along with the IP address of the user to identify the ISP. The IP addresses are only stored for a short duration to identify the ISP and are discarded later, respecting the privacy of users.
